# AI Agent for Stock Prediction and Analysis

This project is an intelligent command-line tool for stock data analysis and news retrieval. It uses **yfinance** to fetch historical stock data, analyzes price trends, retrieves relevant business/tech news around key events, and generates human-like financial insights using an LLM API (Groq).

## Features

- Fetches 1-year historical stock data for any ticker (supports global stocks, e.g., AAPL, MSFT).
- Automatically identifies periods of highest and lowest stock prices.
- Retrieves relevant business/technology news for significant price events.
- Provides a comprehensive analysis, recommendations (Buy/Sell/Hold), and summary using an LLM API.
- Plots stock price history using matplotlib.
- CLI interface with robust error handling.
